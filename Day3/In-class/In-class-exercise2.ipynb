    "The dataset example_tweets.json is the json response returned from the Twitter API. This is a data collected using the keyword search surveillance - tweets that include this keyword are included in the dataset. On [this website](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet) you can find the documentation of the API and the columns it returns. In this challenge, you will explore this data and identify possible privacy and ethical issues with it."
