    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we work with data on U.S. partisan news pages on Facebook. These data were collected and analyzed by Silverman et al. (2017) for this article published on BuzzFeed [Inside The Partisan Fight For Your News Feed](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/inside-the-partisan-fight-for-your-news-feed). The file you will work with is created based on the data available in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2017-08-partisan-sites-and-facebook-pages). \n",
    "\n",
    "In their investigation, the authors created a list of 667 partisan news websites. The websites were added to the list manually by two journalists who were dedicated to identifying partisan news websites. Once a website was added, its associated Facebook page was identified. This was possible for 452 websites. Information on these Facebook pages was collected using the Facebook API. Next, the websites were classified as left- or right-leaning based on a manual review of the content published by the website and its Facebook page, and by examining their About pages for mentions of partisanship. In datasets you will use, you can find information on the Facebook pages, their political leaning as well as information on enagagement. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the exercise you will use the following files:\n",
    "- `pages-info.csv` - dataset about the identified Facebook pages. It contains the following information:\n",
    "    - page_name:  name of the page on Facebook\n",
    "    - about: description of the page\n",
    "    - fan_count: number of fans\n",
    "    - talking_about_count: number of people sharing stories about the page\n",
    "    - website: name of the website related to the page\n",
    "    - page_id: ID of the Facebook page\n",
    "    - year: year when the page was created\n",
    "    - left_leaning: political left leaning of the page (takes value 1 for pages identified as left leaning and 0 for others)\n",
    "    - left_leaning: political right leaning of the page (takes value 1 for pages identified as right leaning and 0 for others)\n",
    "- `engagement_weekly.csv` - dataset about engagement with the identified pages in the last week before 2016 US presidential electiosn. It contains the following information:\n",
    "    - page_id: ID of the Facebook page\n",
    "    - status_published: the period for which engagement was measures (in this case, it is the first week of November 2016 for all pages).\n",
    "    - total_engagement: total number of engagement with the page in the week\n",
    "    - num_reactions: total number of reactions posts by the page recieved in the week (including all possible Facebook reactions)\n",
    "    - num_comments: total number of comments posts by the page recieved in the week\n",
    "    - num_shares: total number of times posts by the page have been shared in the week\n",
    "    - num_likes: total number of likes posts by the page recieved in the week\n",
    "    - num_loves: total number of 'love' reactions posts by the page recieved in the week\n",

    "    - num_hahas: total number of 'haha' reactions posts by the page recieved in the week\n",
